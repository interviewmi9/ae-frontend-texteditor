This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The task
The task was create a component which would provide severa text manipulation and formatting features as well as a synonym lookup and replace functionality. It was required to complete it in a couple of hours, therefore there are no unit tests nor the UI can be considered fully functional yet

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
